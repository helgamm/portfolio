										<h1>Project 3 </h1>
										<p>The objective of this project was to design a 3D model and print it using a 3D printer. 
                                            The model could not be produced using subtractive manufacturing methods. We were also meant to make a 3D scan of an object using photogrammetry </p>

                                        <h2> Inspiration </h2>
                                        <p> Like the pressfit model, I wanted to make something that I could use. I went on pinterest again to get some inspiration. I decided to make a toothbrush holder. 
                                            Here are some ideas that I got inspiration from.
                                        </p>

                                    <h2>Design of the model</h2>
                                    <h3>Softwares I used</h3>
                                    <dl> For this project I used <a href=https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview?term=1-YEAR&support=null&tab=subscription&plc=F360>Fusion 360</a> 
                                        for desiging the model and <a href=https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424>Prusa Slicer</a> to export the model into the correct file format.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <h3>1 - Drawing the base</h3>
                                        <p>I started by creating a sketch and drawing two circles and a rectangle that was tangent to both of them. Then I trimmed the vertical 
                                            sides of the rectangle and the parts of the circles that were on the inside. Then I offsetted the shape by the wall thickness that I had defined
                                            as a user parameter. Then I extruded the shape and made the extrusion symmetric so that the middle of the extrusion would also be the center of the 
                                            working plane. </p>

                                        <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                                            <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/V02/Tannburstastandur/3vol1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                                            <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/V02/Tannburstastandur/3vol2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                                        </div>
                                        
                                    <h3>2 - Making evenly spaced holes</h3>
                                    <p>Then I turned the shape a little bit and created a new sketch ontop of it. There I drew a circle and extruded a cut trough the top wall
                                        and some of the bottom wall so the toothbrush would be more straight when inside the holder. I then added a pattern of the hole I just made
                                        which wen symmetrically on opposite sides and created two new holes. I then mirrored the pattern around the center line of the object. That left
                                        with six evenly spaced holes for the toothbrushes. </p>
                                        <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">

                                    <h3>3 - Adding Chamfers and fillets on the sides</h3>
                                    <p> After adding the holes, I increased the wall thickness in the user parameters. Then I added a chamfer on the inner edge of the walls. I wanted the chamfer to
                                         be clearly visible and big which is why I had to increase the wall thickness. I also added smaller chamfers and fillets on the edges of the holes.</p>
                                    <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                                        <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/V02/Tannburstastandur/3vol6.png" alt="" /></span></div>

                                    </div>

                                    <h3>4 - Improving the Design </h3>
                                    <p>I realised that the holes on the bottom needed to go all the way through the bottom wall because otherwise water from the brushes would accumulate inside the toothbrush holder. 
                                    I made that modification by changing the extrusion length of the holes. I got the idea of adding a spot for toothpaste so I created a new sketch with a 
                                    bigger hole. To do so I had to adjust the length of the model because otherwise it wouldn't fit. I also had the idea to add a gap from the edge to 
                                    the holes so you could easily be able to slide the toothbrushes into place. </p>
                                   <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                                        <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/V02/Tannburstastandur/col10.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                                        <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/V02/Tannburstastandur/col14.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                                    </div>

                                    These modifications made me realise that the previous model was better. By adding a place for the toothpaste I had to expand the toothbrush holder by a lot
                                    and I didn√∞t like the look of it as much as before. Furthermore, I didn't like the sliding feature for the holes, in my opinion my design looked better when
                                     it was symmetric so I decided to go back a few steps in the model and continue working with an old version of the model. I did that by going through
                                     the design process in the bottom banner of Fusion and delete the most recent features. 


                                        
                                    <div id="03_exporting">
                                        <h3>5 - Exporting the design to Prusa Slicer </h3>
                                        <p>When I was fully satisfied with my design I exported the design and imported it in the Prusa Slicer application. To import the document
                                            I selected the square with the plus sign and there I could choose my model. To avoid using supports when printng I turned the model to the side.
                                            I chose the infil to be 15% and then I pressed <b>SLICE NOW</b>. My part was quite big and the Prusa Slicer estimated that it would need 122g of plastic
                                            to be able to print it. As the maximum plastic we could use was 100g I had to change my design a little bit. 
                                            I went back to Fusion, made some changes to the user parameters and uploaded the model into the Prusa Slicer again. After those modifications I was able to
                                            decrease the weight  to 98.7 g of plastic. Then I saved the file on a SD card and plugged it into the Prusa 3D printer. 
                                        
                                        <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
                                        <p>I am very happy with how this project turned out, it's a bit bigger than I expected but I like it. I am really happy with my design and the 3D printer did a very good job with printing it. </p>
