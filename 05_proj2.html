                                        <p>In preparation of this project we estimated the kerf and made a sticker using a vinyl cutter to become more familiar with Inkscape.

                                        <h2> Conceptual Work and Seeking Inspiration </h2>
                                        <p> The purpose of this project was to become familliar with a laser cutter. We were meant to design something that could be manufactured using a laser cutter. The only requirement our design had to fulfill was that it needed to be a pressfit model, meaning it had to have two or more components that would be assembled.  When I started preparing for this project, I was determined to make something that would come of use. The problem was that my vision for the project itself was not as clear. To be fair, I had no idea at all on what I wanted to make. That's why I started looking through Pinterest to find inspiration. Here are a few pictures that caught my eye: </p>

                                            <h3> Phone Charging Station </h3>
                                            <div><p>
                                                At first I had this idea of making a smartphone charging station where I could charge my phone,  
                                                airpods and watch. I started working on my model and made some drafts. I faced some problems with
                                                my design and was not fully happy with it. The watch charger for example is 8mm thick but the material 
                                                I was going to make it from is only 4mm thick so it would never have fitted as I imagined it to. I therefore
                                                decided to go in a completely different direction with this project.  </p>

                                            <h3>The concept becomes clear</h3>

                                            <p> At last I decided to make a cake stand. I saught inspiration in scandinavian aesthetic which is known for it's clean, simple lines,
                                            minimalism and functionality which I implemented into my design. Here are some pictures that describe the mood I was going for </p>

                                        <h3>Softwares I used</h3>
                                        <dl> For this project I used <a href=https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview?term=1-YEAR&support=null&tab=subscription&plc=F360>Fusion 360</a> 
                                            for desiging the model and <a href=https://inkscape.org>Inkscape</a> to vectorize the drawing.</p>
                                        
                                        <h3>1 - Sketching and defining user parameters</h4>
                                        <p>I started with drawing a sketch of my vision. I measured a cake stand we have at home to get an idea of the general measurements.
                                            I used user-parameters throughout the design project. That way, size adjustments to my model were way easier. 
                                            To add a new user parameter I selected <b>MODIFY, CHANGE PARAMETERS</b> in the top banner of Fusion.Then a new window opened with all of the
                                            parameters in the document. There I clicked on <b>NEW USER PARAMETER</b> in the right corner to define a new parameter. I started by logging 
                                            the general parameters that I had decided on in step one but gradually I added more parameters throughout my design. </p>

                                            <!--user params, sketch!!-->
                                    
                                        <h3>2 - Drawing the plate</h3>
                                            <p>When the most basic user-parameters had been defined I started drawing the plate in Fusion. 
                                            I started by double clicking on the name of the drawing in the side banner and chose <b>NEW COMPONENT</b> and named it 'Diskur'. 
                                        
                                            I made a new sketch and drew a circle in the middle of the plane and constrained it to be the size that I had defined as 'Þvermál'. 
                                            Then I extruded the sketch so it would become the same thickness as the thickness of the material, which was a parameter that I had 
                                            already defined as well.</p>

                                        <p>When drawing the feet I began by making a new component, created a new sketch and drew it similar to the sketch I had created. 
                                            I added some new parameters such as the depth of the upper part that is connected to the plate and the width of the feet.
                                            Then I extruded my sketch so that it became equal to the thickness of the material.</p>

                                            <!--v2, v3-->
                                        <p>Then I made a new sketch on top of the one I had just created and made a rectangle on top which I then extruded</p>
                                        <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">

                                        <h3>4 - Duplicating the feet</h3>
                                        <p>When I had created one foot I right clicked on the part in the side menu and copied it. Then I right clicked the name of the assembly
                                        and selected <b>PASTE NEW</b>, that way if I would make changes to foot 1 it would not affect foot 2. When I pasted the foot, I was able to move it
                                        90 degrees on the z-axis. </p>
                                        <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">

                                        <h3>5 - Making slits</h3>
                                        <p>I selected foot 1 and created a new sketch on the face of the foot. There I drew a rectangle from the top of the foot. 
                                        It's width was the thickness of the material minus the kerf I had found in a previous assignment. Then I extruded the rectangle
                                        so it cut through the already existing foot and made a slit. I did the same thing on the other foot bu this time the slit was at the bottom but not the top.
                                        Because there were sharp corners inside the slit I decided to draw a small circle with the kerf length as a diameter, it was then placed half a kerf length from the corners.
                                        That way, the cutter can reach the corners. I then selected the plate and made slits where the feet would touch the plate and extruded through the material.</p>

                                        <h3>6 - Adding Reinforcements </h3>

                                        I realised that these two feet would not provide enough stability for the stand. Therefore I devided to add some reinforcement. I made two more slits on foot 1 that were placed 
                                        at an equal distance from the center line. Then I created a new component, drew the part and extruded it so it would have the same thickness as the material. 
                                        I copied it and this time selected <b>PASTE</b> so that if I'd have to change the original sketch, the other one would update as well.</p>

                                        <h3>7 - Finishing touches </h3>
                                        <p>I then went through all of the components and put a fillet of 1mm at least on all corners so they wouldn't be as sharp. Now the model was ready but I was a bit stressed about
                                        the kerf I had chosen, because that determines how well the model fits together. I did some measurements and adjusted the numbers a little bit. Then it was time to turn 
                                        the 3D model into a 2D sketch. I did that by creating a new component which I called CAD layout. Then I copied and pasted all of the parts into that component.
                                        (not paste new because I wanted the components to be linked with the 3D model). Then I selected one component at a time and aligned it to the XY plane. I did that through
                                        <b>ALIGN, selected the face of the component and then the XY plane</b>. Then all of the components were laying flat on one plane, just be careful that all of them have the 
                                        same side facing the plane such that the extrusion for every part points in the same direction.</p>

                                        <h3>8 - Exporting the design to Inkscape </h3>
                                        <p>To export the file I selected <b>FILE, EXPORT</b> and chose dwg format. Then I opened the dwg file in Inkscape where I could scale it a bit. I had some trouble with this step because
                                        every time I'd open the file in inkscape it showed constructionlines as well as outlines. To get rid of those I copied the CAD layout into a new Fusion document, exported it and opened it 
                                        in Autocad. There I could delete the unnecessary lines that I didn't want to show in Inkscape. Inkscape then adjusted the file so that the laser cutter could read it. I had some trouble with
                                        printing because the only material left was a bit bent. This could have a lot of impact on how my parts would fit together because the measurements have to be very precise. I ended up cutting the parts
                                        separately and put some bits of used material as support to make the plywood board lie more flat. </p>


                                        <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
                                        <p>I am very happy with how this project turned out. Even though it looks simple, there is a lot of thought behind it. The model is very press-fit and a bit hard to assemble the pieces. I did a lot of measurements,
                                        and testing so I think the reason for the tight fit might be because of how bent the material was that I ended up using.  </p>
